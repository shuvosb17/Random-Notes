 **difference table** between a **compiler** and an **interpreter** 👇

| No. | **Compiler**                                                                      | **Interpreter**                                                  |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ | Translates the **entire source code** into machine code at once before execution. | Translates and executes the **source code line by line**.        |
| 2️⃣ | Produces an **independent executable file** (target program).                     | **No separate file** is created; executes code directly.         |
| 3️⃣ | **Faster execution** after compilation because the code is already translated.    | **Slower execution** since each line is interpreted every time.  |
| 4️⃣ | **Errors are shown after** the whole program is compiled.                         | **Errors are shown immediately** after each line is interpreted. |
| 5️⃣ | Examples: **C, C++, Go, Rust, Java (partially)**                                  | Examples: **Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby**                      |

**short and clear explanation** of the **Language Processing System** shown in your diagram 👇

### 🧠 **Language Processing System (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Source Program**
   ➜ The code you write (e.g., in C, C++, etc.).

2. **Preprocessor**
   ➜ Handles tasks like **macro expansion**, **file inclusion** (`#include`), and **conditional compilation** before actual compilation.
   🔹 Output: *Modified source program.*

3. **Compiler**
   ➜ Translates the modified source code into **assembly code** (human-readable machine instructions).
   🔹 Output: *Target assembly program.*

4. **Assembler**
   ➜ Converts the assembly code into **object code** (machine-readable binary form).
   🔹 Output: *Relocatable machine code.*

5. **Linker/Loader**
   ➜ **Linker** combines all object files and required **library files** into one complete executable.
   ➜ **Loader** loads this executable into memory for execution.
   🔹 Output: *Target machine code (final executable).*

### ⚙️ **Summary**

| Step | Component     | Main Function                    | Output               |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Preprocessor  | Handles macros and includes      | Modified source code |
| 2️⃣  | Compiler      | Converts to assembly             | Assembly code        |
| 3️⃣  | Assembler     | Converts to object code          | Machine code         |
| 4️⃣  | Linker/Loader | Combines and loads for execution | Executable file      |

💡 **In simple words:**
Your written code passes through several translators—each bringing it closer to a form the computer can actually execute.
