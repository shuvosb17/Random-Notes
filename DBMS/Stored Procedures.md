## What is a Stored Procedure? üõ†Ô∏è

A **stored procedure** is a set of SQL statements saved in the database with a name.  
You can call (run) this procedure whenever you want, just like calling a function in programming.

**Why use Stored Procedures?**
- To reuse code (no need to rewrite the same SQL).
- To organize complex operations.
- To improve security (hide SQL logic from users).
- To make database management easier.

## How Does a Stored Procedure Work? ‚öôÔ∏è

- You define the procedure once in the database.
- You call the procedure by its name, passing any required parameters.
- The procedure runs its SQL statements and can return results.

**Example Flow:**  
1. You create a procedure to get user details by ID.
2. Whenever you need user info, you call the procedure with the user‚Äôs ID.

## How to Create a Stored Procedure üìù

**Syntax:**
````sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name ([parameters])
BEGIN
  -- SQL statements
END;
````

**Example:**  
A procedure to get user details by ID:

````sql
CREATE PROCEDURE getUserById(IN userId INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = userId;
END;
````

---

## How to Apply (Use) a Stored Procedure üö¶

- You call the procedure using the `CALL` statement.
- You can pass parameters if the procedure needs them.

**Example Usage:**  
````sql
CALL getUserById(5);
````

**What happens?**  
- The procedure runs the SELECT query for user with ID 5.
- The result is returned to you.

---

## Output After Running Query üìã

- The procedure executes its SQL statements.
- You get the result, such as a table of data, a message, or an update.

**Example Output:**  
After calling `CALL getUserById(5);`, you might see:

| id | name  | email             |
|----|-------|-------------------|
| 5  | Alice | alice@example.com |

---

## Key Concepts & Rules üß†

- Procedures can take input parameters (`IN`), output parameters (`OUT`), or both.
- Procedures can contain multiple SQL statements, including logic (IF, LOOP).
- Procedures can be reused many times.
- Procedures help keep your code organized and secure.

| Concept         | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| What is it?     | Named set of SQL statements                  |
| How to create   | `CREATE PROCEDURE ...`                       |
| How to use      | `CALL procedure_name(parameters)`            |
| Output          | Result of SQL statements (data, update, etc) |
| Benefits        | Reuse, organization, security                |

**In short:**  
Stored procedures are like reusable tools in MySQL. You create them once, then call them whenever you need to perform a task‚Äîmaking your database work easier, faster, and safer!
