## What is a View? üëì

A **view** is a virtual table in MySQL.  
It‚Äôs based on a SELECT query and shows data from one or more tables in a specific way.  
A view does **not** store data itself‚Äîit just displays data from the underlying tables.

**Why use Views?**
- To simplify complex queries.
- To show only certain columns or rows to users.
- To improve security by hiding sensitive data.
- To present data in a customized format.

## How Does a View Work? ‚öôÔ∏è

- You define a view using a SELECT statement.
- When you query the view, MySQL runs the SELECT statement and shows the result as if it were a table.
- You can use views in SELECT, JOIN, and other queries just like regular tables.

**Example Flow:**  
1. You create a view to show only active users.
2. When you query the view, you see only those users, not all users.

## How to Create a View üìù

**Syntax:**
````sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition;
````

**Example:**  
A view to show only active users:

````sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
````

## How to Use a View üö¶

- Query the view just like a table.

**Example Usage:**  
````sql
SELECT * FROM active_users;
````

**What happens?**  
- MySQL runs the SELECT statement inside the view.
- You see only active users.

---

## Output After Running Query üìã

- The output is the result of the SELECT statement used to define the view.

**Example Output:**  
After running `SELECT * FROM active_users;`, you might see:

| id | name  | email             |
|----|-------|-------------------|
| 1  | Alice | alice@example.com |
| 2  | Bob   | bob@example.com   |

## Key Concepts & Rules üß†

- Views are **virtual**‚Äîthey don‚Äôt store data.
- You can use views to simplify queries and hide complexity.
- Views can be updated if the underlying query allows it (some views are read-only).
- Dropping a view does **not** affect the original tables.

**In short:**  
A view is a smart window into your data. It lets you see exactly what you need, hides what you don‚Äôt, and makes working with complex data much easier!
