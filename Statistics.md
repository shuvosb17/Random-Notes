Good — I’ll do **Chapter 6 (Shape of the Distribution)** for you: explain the formulas, compute the requested coefficients for the exercises in the file, and interpret the results with clear, real-life meanings. I’ll use the definitions and conventions shown in your PDF. 

---

# 1) Quick reminder of the formulas (from your file) 

Let the data values be (x_1,\dots,x_n) and the mean be (\bar x).

Population central moments:
[
\mu_k=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^k
]

**Moment-based skewness (the usual Pearson moment skewness):**
[
\text{skewness }(\gamma_1)=\frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}}
]
The PDF also shows (\beta_1=\gamma_1^2) (a nonnegative measure derived from moments).

Interpretation guidance used in the PDF:

* (\gamma_1 = 0) → symmetric.
* (0 < |\gamma_1| \le 1) → skewed (mild).
* (1 < |\gamma_1| \le 2) → moderately skewed.
* (2 < |\gamma_1| \le 3) → highly skewed.
  (negative signs indicate left/negative skew, positive indicates right/positive skew). 

**Kurtosis (Pearson’s (\beta_2)):**
[
\beta_2=\frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^{2}}
]

* (\beta_2 = 3) → mesokurtic (like normal).
* (\beta_2 >3) → leptokurtic (sharper peak, heavier tails).
* (\beta_2 <3) → platykurtic (flatter peak, lighter tails).

# 2) Notes on the exercises & an assumption

Your file lists two exercises:

1. Marks of 10 students:
   `15, 25, 48, 50, 65, 95, 18, 85, 75, 55` — compute coefficient of skewness. 

2. Time of reading newspaper of 6 people (but the file actually lists **7 numbers**):
   `3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 5` — compute coefficient of kurtosis. 

Because the second line lists 7 values despite saying “6 people”, I will **use all 7 numbers** (best-effort decision). If you intended 6 values only, tell me which one to drop and I’ll recompute.

# 3) Work — step by step (I computed the central moments and then the coefficients)

### Exercise 1 — Marks (10 students)

Data: (15,25,48,50,65,95,18,85,75,55)

Computed values (rounded for readability):

* (n=10)
* Mean (\bar x = 53.100)

Central moments (population-style; divide by (n)):

* (\mu_2 = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum (x-\bar x)^2 ;=; 690.690)  (variance-like)
* (\mu_3 = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum (x-\bar x)^3 ;=; -268.308)
* (\mu_4 = \dfrac{1}{n}\sum (x-\bar x)^4 ;=; 861706.182)

Skewness:
[
\gamma_1=\frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}} \approx \frac{-268.308}{(690.690)^{1.5}} \approx -0.01478
]

(\beta_1=\gamma_1^2 \approx 0.00022) (nonnegative square).

Interpretation:

* (\gamma_1 \approx -0.0148) is **almost zero** → the marks distribution is **essentially symmetric** (no meaningful skew).
* Magnitude is far below 1, so according to the PDF’s categories this is **not skewed** (practically symmetric). 

Real-life meaning:

* The marks are balanced around the mean: there is no long tail to the left or right — high and low scores are roughly balanced. No evidence of many extreme low or extreme high marks.

### Exercise 2 — Newspaper reading times (I used 7 values)

Data used: (3,4,2,4,6,2,5)  (7 observations; mean ≈ 3.7143)

Computed values:

* (n=7)
* Mean (\bar x \approx 3.7142857)

Central moments:

* (\mu_2 \approx 1.91836735)
* (\mu_3 \approx 0.52478134)
* (\mu_4 \approx 6.79633486)

Skewness:
[
\gamma_1=\frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}} \approx \frac{0.524781}{(1.918367)^{1.5}} \approx 0.19751
]
This is a **small positive skew** (a little tail to the right).

Kurtosis:
[
\beta_2=\frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2^{2}} \approx \frac{6.796335}{(1.918367)^2} \approx 1.84676
]

Interpretation:

* (\gamma_1 \approx 0.198) → **slight right (positive) skew**: a few people read somewhat more than the typical reader. 
* (\beta_2 \approx 1.847 < 3) → **platykurtic**: the distribution is **flatter than a normal distribution** (a lower central peak and lighter tails).

Real-life meaning:

* Most people read around the central time (~3–4 hours in this data), but a small number read more (hence slight right tail).
* Platykurtic result means times are relatively spread out and there are fewer extreme very-short or very-long reading times than you’d expect under a normal curve.

# 4) Short summary table (rounded)

| Exercise          |  n |  Mean | Skewness (γ₁) | Interpretation (skew)        | Kurtosis (β₂) | Interpretation (kurtosis)         |
| ----------------- | -: | ----: | ------------: | ---------------------------- | ------------: | --------------------------------- |
| Marks (10)        | 10 | 53.10 |       −0.0148 | ~ symmetric (no skew)        |         1.806 | platykurtic (flatter than normal) |
| Reading times (7) |  7 | 3.714 |       +0.1975 | slight positive (right) skew |         1.847 | platykurtic (flatter than normal) |

*(Numbers rounded to 3–4 decimals.)*

# 5) Intuition & practical takeaways

* **Skewness near 0** means the distribution is balanced around the center (mean ≈ median). For marks that suggests no systematic bias of many very low or very high scores.
* **Positive skew** (right tail) occurs when a small number of observations are much larger than the bulk (e.g., a few people who read far longer than average).
* **Kurtosis < 3 (platykurtic)** means the data’s peak is lower and the body wider than a normal curve — less clustering near the mean and fewer extreme outliers than a normal distribution would predict.

Real examples:

* Employee salaries often show **positive skew** (a few very high earners).
* Daily temperatures might be roughly symmetric.
* Reaction times are often **right-skewed** (most are quick, a few are slow).

# 6) Would you like any of these next?

* I can **show the full calculation table** (each ((x-\bar x)^k) row) for either dataset.
* I can compute **sample-based** versions of skewness/kurtosis (with Bessel-type corrections) if you need statistics compatible with software packages.
* I can **plot** the distributions (histogram + box plot) to visualize skew and kurtosis.

Tell me which and I’ll produce it right away.
